To conclude, I believe I have successfully achieved my question of investigating the prevailing factors that influence maternal mortality. My objectives helped my achieve this goal but also portraying a story of my study 

I start with wider portrait of the data, finding both Europe and African regions as points of comparison, evaluating the mortality rate with each continent. I then hone into both Italy and Sierra Leone using metrics such as average amount of anaemia in pregnant women to draw comparable conclusions within the limits of the dataset. Additionally, I finalise the results by seeing how to mortality rate and other statistics have changed between the start of 2000 to 2017. Adding a forecast trend so how the data predicts these values will change in the future. 

With the most recent data, I found Europe to have an average of 22.50% anaemic pregnant women. Compared to Africa, which had 46.98% of pregnancies had anaemic levels of iron. When we sum the skilled attendance by region, we find Africa to have a small amount of skilled attendance during pregnancies at just 16,962. When looking European skilled attendance we denote 68,230 skilled personnel, a stark difference. 

Africa also has the lowest average of caesarean births, at just 7.13. Compared to Europe at a average of 25.20. This can be connoted with potential medical disparities. 

These metrics followed these trends throughout the investigation. 

I found a consistent trend between Europe, Africa and Eastern Mediterranean regions have increased their percentage of skilled personnel 
I found Sierra Leone to have the highest rates of maternal mortality within the dataset with an average of 1,571.1 deaths per 100,000 births. 

Italy had the lowest rate of maternal mortality rate of an average of 2.389 deaths per 100,000 births. 

We can predict that these general trends of improvement will continue in the coming years.
